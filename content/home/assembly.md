## ALE score

A generic assembly likelihood evaluation framework for assessing the accuracy of genome and metagenome assemblies

> The assembly with the higher ALE score is also the one with the larger probability of being correct. Moreover, the difference between two assembliesâ€™ ALE scores describes their relative probabilities of correctness.

## ALE score

-   **Placement** - how well the reads match where they map (matches/orientation)
-   **Insert** - how well the mate pair's insert lengths match the expected length
-   **Depth** - how well depth at position agrees with expected, given GC content at location
-   **K-mer** - describes the likelihood of the assembly based on k-mer frequencies
